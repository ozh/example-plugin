# Example Plugin

Example of a YOURLS plugin installable with Composer.

## Installation

In your YOURLS root: `composer require ozh/example-plugin`

How does it work? Thanks to the YOURLS [custom installer](https://github.com/YOURLS/composer-installer) that is listed as a [dependency of this plugin](https://github.com/ozh/example-plugin/blob/1.0/composer.json#L19), Composer will download this plugin and place it in your `user/plugins/` directory.

(Or, of course, just as any plugin you could install it the regular way)

## Usage

It does nothing, it's just a demo
